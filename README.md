# Brainfuck-Connect4
Connect 4 implemented in brainfuck

# Cointais
There is a brainfuck interpreter in this project made by me. You can use it, or any other 
interpreter you can find. Keep in mind that some of the interpreters don't wait for you 
to type an input. My one does!

There are also two Connect 4 codes. One is commented and one is a block of brainfuck code. Feel 
free to use either one of them.

# How to play
In Connect 4 you try to get 4 of your coins in a row. They can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal.
You put a coin from the top to one of the rows. It falls down until it hits another coin.
The first one to get 4 coins in a row wins.

In this game, player 1s coins are represented with X's and player 2s 0's
Type a number between 1 and 7 to put a coin into that slot.

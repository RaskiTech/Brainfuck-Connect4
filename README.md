# Brainfuck Connect 4
Connect 4 implemented in brainfuck


# Cointais

There is a brainfuck interpreter in this project made by me. You can use it, or any other 
interpreter you can find. Keep in mind that some of the interpreters don't wait for you 
to type an input, whitch really hinders the usability. However, my interpreter waits so you
can use that if you don't find anythin else!

There are also two Connect 4 source codes in this project. One is fully commented and the otherone is a full block of brainfuck code. Feel 
free to use either one of them.


# How to play

Connect 4

In Connect 4 you try to get 4 of your own coins in a row. They can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal, it doesn't matter.
When it's your turn, you insert a coin into the game in one of the rows. The coin falls down until it hits another coin or the floor. Two players take turns after eachother, each putting their own coin in.
The first one to get 4 coins in a row wins.

This implementation

In this game, player 1s coins are represented with X's and player 2s 0's.
Type a number between 1 and 7 to put a coin into that slot. Then it's the next persons turn.
The first one to 4 in a row wins

# Brainfuck Connect 4
Connect 4 implemented in brainfuck


# Includes

Includes a custom made brainfuck interpreter, as well as the actual program. You can use the provided interpreter, or any other you can find. Keep in mind that some of them don't wait for you to type an input, which really hinders the playability of this little game. However, the custom-made one does.

The project contains two Connect 4 source codes. One of them has comments, the other one doesn't. Feel free to use either one of them.

# How to play

Rules of Connect 4

In Connect 4 you try to get 4 of your own coins in a row. They can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal, it doesn't matter.
When it's your turn, you insert a coin into one of the rows. The coin falls down until it hits another coin or the table. Two players take turns after eachother, each putting their own coin in.
The first one to get 4 coins in a row wins.

This implementation

In this game, player 1s coins are represented with X's and player 2s 0's.
Type a number between 1 and 7 to put a coin into that slot. Then it's the next persons turn.
The first one to 4 in a row wins
